 * > JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format,
 * > based on a subset of the
 * > [JavaScript Programming Language](http://javascript.crockford.com/),
 * > [Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ecma-st/ECMA-262.pdf).
 * > JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses
 * > conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages,
 * > including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others.
 * > These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.
 *
 * > JSON is built on two structures:
 *
 * > - A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized
 * >   as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or
 * >   associative array.
 *
 * > - An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an
 * >   array, vector, list, or sequence.
